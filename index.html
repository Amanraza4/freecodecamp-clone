    <h2 class="h-2">Please slow down and read this.</h2>

    <p class="p-1">freeCodeCamp is a proven path to your first software developer job.</p>
    <p class="p-2">More than 40,000 people have gotten developer jobs after completing this – including at big companies like Google and Microsoft.</p>
    <p class="p-3">If you are new to programming, we recommend you start at the beginning and earn these certifications in order.</p>
    <p  class="p-4">To earn each certification, build its 5 required projects and get all their tests to pass.</p>
    <p  class="p-5">You can add these certifications to your résumé or LinkedIn. But more important than the certifications is the practice you get along the way.</p>
    <p class="p-6">If you feel overwhelmed, that is normal. Programming is hard.</p>
    <p class="p-7">Practice is the key. Practice, practice, practice.</p>
    <p class="p-8">And this curriculum will give you thousands of hours of hands-on programming practice.</p>
    <p class="p-9">And if you want to learn more math and computer science theory, we also have thousands of hours of video courses on freeCodeCamp's YouTube channel.</p>
    <p class="p-10">If you want to get a developer job or freelance clients, programming skills will be just part of the puzzle. You also need to build your personal network and your reputation as a developer.</p>
    <p class="p-11">You can do this on Twitter and GitHub, and also on the freeCodeCamp forum.</p>
    <p class="p-12">Happy coding!</p>
